# Travelling Salesman Problem in C (2013)
A C program to solve the Travelling Salesman Problem with multiple threads (and communication via MPI). This was a project for Data structures &amp; algorithms 3 and won the contest for the fastest implementation of the year 2013. This was achieved by implementing a complex algorithm to calculate the Held-Karp lower bound and optimizing the whole program as much as possible without compromising code readability. The Dutch report can be found under `extra/verslag.pdf`.
